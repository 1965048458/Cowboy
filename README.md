# Cowboy
Cowboy is a HTTP library for building HTTP based services.

Cowboy actually is kind of a Nancy-Lite which I shrink the code size of the [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) framework.
What I need here is just an API service with super simple GET and POST, no extensibility needed, no customization needed, no view engine needed, no cookie and session needed.
